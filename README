Nomad is a distributed file system supporting disconnected operation.

The current goals include:
 - architecture and OS agnostic code
 - client-server architecture
 - untrusted client
 - disconnected operation
 - support for special files (named pipes, symlinks, etc.)
 - Unix-style file permissions
 - multi-user capable server

Once these are done, we will reevaluate the next set of goals.


Building and Installing
=======================

$ cmake . -DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX=/prefix
$ make
$ make install

This will build and install the binaries and libraries under the specficied
prefix.


Internal Dependencies
=====================

             | sunavl | sunlist | common | fakeumem | objstore | suntaskq
-------------+--------+---------+--------+----------+----------+----------
sunavl       |   -    |    n    |   n    |    n     |    n     |     n
sunlist      |   n    |    -    |   n    |    n     |    n     |     n
common       |   n    |    n    |   -    |    y     |    n     |     n 
fakeumem     |   n    |    n    |   n    |    -     |    n     |     n
objstore     |   n    |    n    |   n    |    y     |    -     |     n
suntaskq     |   n    |    n    |   y    |    y     |    n     |     -
objs. module |   ?    |    ?    |   y    |    y     |    n     |     n
client       |   n    |    n    |   n    |    y     |    n     |     n
server       |   n    |    n    |   n    |    y     |    n     |     n
tool         |   n    |    n    |   n    |    y     |    n     |     n

  y = yes, linked against
  n = no, not linked against
  - = not applicable
  ? = may be linked against as necessary

The above table assumes the lack of avl, cmdutils, and umem libraries on the
system.  If they are present, they are used instead of sunavl, sunlist, and
fakeumem respectively.
