Nomad is a distributed file system supporting disconnected operation.

The current goals include:
 - architecture and OS agnostic code
 - client-server architecture
 - untrusted client
 - disconnected operation
 - support for special files (named pipes, symlinks, etc.)
 - Unix-style file permissions
 - multi-user capable server

Once these are done, we will reevaluate the next set of goals.
